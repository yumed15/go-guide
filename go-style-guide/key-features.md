# Key Features

* **statically typed** (performs type checking at compile time, opposed to dynamically-typed languages which perform type checking at runtime e.g. python, js, ruby etc)
* **compiled language** (converted directly into machine code that the processor can execute -need a “build” step to be manually compiled first. You'll need to “rebuild” the program every time you need to make a change - can be faster and more efficient than interpreted languages where the source code is not directly translated by the target machine. Instead, a _different_ program, aka the interpreter, reads and executes the code. Interpreted languages were once significantly slower than compiled languages. But, with the development of [just-in-time compilation](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/computer-science/just-in-time-compilation), that gap is shrinking.)
* with a built-in **concurrency** a system
* with a **garbage collector**
